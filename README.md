# Info Docker CI/CD

According to the 2020 Jetbrains developer survey , 44% of developers are now using some form of continuous integration and deployment with Docker containers. We understand that a large number of developers have got this set up using Docker Hub as their container registry for part of their workflow. This guide contains some best practices for doing this and provides guidance on how to get started.

We have also heard feedback that given the changes Docker introduced relating to network egress and the number of pulls for free users, that there are questions around the best way to use Docker Hub as part of CI/CD workflows without hitting these limits. This guide covers best practices that improve your experience and uses a sensible consumption of Docker Hub which mitigates the risk of hitting these limits, and contains tips on how to increase the limits depending on your use case.
